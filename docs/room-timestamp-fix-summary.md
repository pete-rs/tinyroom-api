# Room Timestamp Update Fix Summary

## Issue
When User A adds an element to a room, User B refreshes MyRooms but the room doesn't appear at the top of the list.

## Root Cause
The room's `updatedAt` timestamp was being updated in a `setImmediate` callback (background task), which runs AFTER the response is sent. This created a race condition:

1. User A creates element
2. Socket emits `element:created` immediately
3. Room update scheduled for background
4. User B receives event and refreshes MyRooms
5. User B gets room list BEFORE `updatedAt` is updated
6. Room appears in wrong position

## Solution
Moved the room `updatedAt` update to happen IMMEDIATELY (synchronously) before sending socket events:

### Before (Race Condition):
```javascript
// Create element
const element = await prisma.element.create({...});

// Send response immediately
socket.emit('element:created', elementResponse);

// Update room in background - TOO LATE!
setImmediate(async () => {
  await prisma.room.update({
    where: { id: roomId },
    data: {} // Triggers @updatedAt
  });
});
```

### After (Fixed):
```javascript
// Create element
const element = await prisma.element.create({...});

// Update room IMMEDIATELY
await prisma.room.update({
  where: { id: roomId },
  data: {} // Triggers @updatedAt
});

// Then send response
socket.emit('element:created', elementResponse);
```

## Changes Made

1. **Element Creation** - Room updates immediately after element is created
2. **Element Update** - Room updates immediately after element is modified
3. **Element Deletion** - Room updates immediately after element is deleted
4. **Room Clear** - Already updating immediately (no change needed)

## Impact

- Room ordering is now guaranteed to be correct
- No more race conditions between updates and fetches
- MyRooms will always show the correct order
- Small performance trade-off (few ms) for consistency

## For iOS Team

No changes needed on iOS side. The fix ensures that when you receive any element event and refresh MyRooms, the room will have the correct `updatedAt` timestamp and appear at the top of the list.
