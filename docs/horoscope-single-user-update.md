# Horoscope Feature Update - Single User Generation

## Overview
The horoscope feature has been updated to generate readings for the requesting user only, with a modern, witty style inspired by viral zodiac memes.

## API Changes

### Endpoint
**UNCHANGED**: `POST /api/horoscope/rooms/:roomId/generate`

Still requires roomId parameter as the horoscope element will be placed in the room.

### Response Format
```json
{
  "data": {
    "theme": "Today's theme (e.g., 'Communication habits')",
    "readings": [
      {
        "name": "User's first name",
        "sign": "Zodiac sign",
        "horoscope": "120-140 character observation combining sign traits with theme"
      }
    ],
    "generatedAt": "2024-01-15T10:00:00Z"
  }
}
```

### Key Changes:
1. **No introduction field** - Removed the mystical introduction
2. **Theme field added** - Indicates today's reading theme
3. **Single reading** - Array contains only one reading for the requesting user
4. **Modern tone** - Sharp, witty, culturally aware (no mysticism)
5. **Character limit** - Each horoscope is 120-140 characters (like a tweet)
6. **High variety** - Temperature set to 0.95 with varied sentence structures to prevent repetitive patterns

## Themes
The AI randomly selects one theme per reading from:
- Communication habits (texts, emails, phone calls, read receipts)
- Money/spending behaviors (Venmo requests, impulse buys, splitting bills)
- Dating/relationship patterns (dating apps, commitment issues, love languages)
- Work/productivity quirks (emails, meetings, procrastination methods)
- Social media behaviors (posting, lurking, story viewing)
- Self-care delusions (skincare routines they don't follow, gym memberships)
- Friend group dynamics (group chat roles, party behaviors)
- Daily routines (morning habits, sleep patterns, meal choices)
- Emotional coping mechanisms (therapy avoidance, comfort behaviors)
- Secret shames (guilty pleasures, hidden anxieties)

## Style Guide
- Dry and matter-of-fact tone
- Pop-culture references
- Gently roasting but affirming
- Hyper-specific behaviors
- Feels like a text from a friend who knows you too well

## iOS Implementation Notes

### Creating Horoscope Element
When creating a horoscope element, you'll need to:
1. Call the endpoint to generate the horoscope for the current user
2. Parse the theme and reading
3. Create the element with the horoscope content

```swift
// 1. Generate horoscope for current user in the room
let horoscopeData = await generateHoroscope(roomId: roomId)

// 2. Create element with horoscope content
socket.emit("element:create", [
    "roomId": roomId,
    "type": "horoscope",
    "positionX": position.x,
    "positionY": position.y,
    "width": 300,
    "height": 200,
    "content": JSONEncoder().encode([
        "theme": horoscopeData.theme,
        "reading": horoscopeData.readings[0]
    ])
])
```

### Display Changes
- Show the theme prominently
- Display the horoscope text in a modern, clean style
- Remove any mystical imagery or styling
- Consider using a card-based design with the theme as a header

## Variety Improvements
To prevent repetitive patterns:
- **Temperature**: Set to 0.95 (high) for more creative variations
- **Varied openings**: System prompts emphasize different sentence structures
- **Random prompt seeds**: Different opening lines to inspire varied responses
- **Explicit instructions**: AI instructed to avoid starting patterns like "You type..." repeatedly

## Migration Notes
- Old horoscope elements will still display with their original format
- New horoscopes use the updated single-user generation
- The backend maintains backward compatibility for existing elements
