# In-App Notifications Update Summary

## New Notification Types Added

We've added support for all remaining notification types (4-10) to the in-app notifications system:

### 1. **ROOM_DELETED**
- Triggered when: Room creator deletes a room
- Recipients: All participants except the creator
- Display: "{actor} deleted the room {roomName}"
- Deep link: Opens room (will show error since room no longer exists)
- Not batched

### 2. **ADDED_TO_ROOM**
- Triggered when: Room creator adds new participants
- Recipients: Newly added participants
- Display: "{actor} added you to {roomName}"
- Deep link: Opens room
- Not batched

### 3. **REMOVED_FROM_ROOM**
- Triggered when: Room creator removes participants
- Recipients: Removed participants
- Display: "{actor} removed you from {roomName}"
- Deep link: Opens room (will show access denied)
- Not batched

### 4. **COMMENT_ADDED**

- Recipients: All room participants except commenter
- Display: "{actor}: {commentPreview}"
- Deep link: Opens room

### 5. **MENTION**
- Triggered when: Someone mentions user with @username
- Recipients: Mentioned users
- Display: "{actor} mentioned you: {commentPreview}"
- Deep link: Opens room
- Shows up to 100 characters of comment
- Not batched

### 6. **USER_FOLLOWED**
- Triggered when: Someone follows a user
- Recipients: The followed user
- Display: "{actor} started following you"
- Deep link: Opens actor's profile
- **Special feature**: Includes `isFollowingBack` field
- Not batched

## Special Features

### Follow Button for USER_FOLLOWED Notifications
The USER_FOLLOWED notification includes an `isFollowingBack` boolean field that iOS can use to show a follow/following button directly in the notification cell:

```json
{
  "type": "USER_FOLLOWED",
  "displayText": "Sarah started following you",
  "isFollowingBack": false,  // Shows if current user follows them back
  "actor": { ... },
  "deepLink": {
    "type": "profile",
    "actorId": "user-999"
  }
}
```

## Integration Points Updated

### Controllers Modified:
1. **roomController.ts**
   - `deleteRoom()` - Creates ROOM_DELETED notifications
   - `addParticipants()` - Creates ADDED_TO_ROOM notifications
   - `removeParticipants()` - Creates REMOVED_FROM_ROOM notifications

2. **roomCommentController.ts**
   - `createComment()` - Creates COMMENT_ADDED and MENTION notifications

3. **followController.ts**
   - `followUser()` - Creates USER_FOLLOWED notifications

### Notification Service Updates:
- Added all new notification types to the enum
- Updated display text generation for each type
- Added follow status lookup for USER_FOLLOWED notifications
- Updated deep link type mapping

## API Response Changes

### USER_FOLLOWED Notifications Include:
```json
{
  "id": "notif-125",
  "type": "USER_FOLLOWED",
  "displayText": "Sarah started following you",
  "isFollowingBack": false,  // New field!
  "actor": { ... },
  "deepLink": {
    "type": "profile",
    "actorId": "user-999"
  }
}
```

### Comment Notifications Include Preview:
```json
{
  "type": "COMMENT_ADDED",
  "displayText": "John: Hey everyone, check this out!",
  "roomName": "Team Chat",
  "deepLink": {
    "type": "room",
    "roomId": "room-123"
  }
}
```

## Performance Considerations

1. **No Batching**: None of the new notification types are batched
2. **Follow Status**: Only queried for USER_FOLLOWED notifications
3. **Comment Previews**: Limited to 100 characters
4. **Background Processing**: All notifications created asynchronously

## Testing Checklist

1. Delete a room and verify all participants get notified
2. Add users to a room and verify they get notified
3. Remove users from a room and verify they get notified
4. Post a comment and verify other participants get notified
5. Mention users in comments and verify they get notified
6. Follow a user and verify they get notified with correct `isFollowingBack` status
7. Test deep linking for each notification type
8. Verify notification text displays correctly
