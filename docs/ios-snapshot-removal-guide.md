# iOS Snapshot Removal Guide

## Overview
The room snapshot feature has been completely removed from the backend API. This document outlines all iOS app changes required to handle this removal.

## Removed API Endpoint
- `POST /api/upload/room/:roomId/snapshot` - No longer exists

## When Snapshots Were Being Called

Based on the backend implementation, snapshots were likely being uploaded at these points:

1. **When joining a room** - To capture the current state when a user enters
2. **When leaving a room** - To save the final state when a user exits
3. **After significant changes** - Possibly after adding multiple elements
4. **Background upload** - May have been queued for upload when the app goes to background

## API Response Changes

### 1. GET /api/rooms/my-rooms
**Before:**
```json
{
  "data": [{
    "id": "room-id",
    "name": "Room Name",
    "snapshotUrl": "https://cloudinary.com/...", // REMOVED
    "createdAt": "2025-06-14T...",
    "updatedAt": "2025-06-14T...",
    // ... other fields
  }]
}
```

**After:**
```json
{
  "data": [{
    "id": "room-id",
    "name": "Room Name",
    // snapshotUrl field no longer exists
    "createdAt": "2025-06-14T...",
    "updatedAt": "2025-06-14T...",
    // ... other fields
  }]
}
```

### 2. GET /api/rooms/:id
The `snapshotUrl` field has been removed from individual room responses as well.

### 3. GET /api/rooms/grouped-by-person (if still used)
Rooms no longer include `snapshotUrl` in the response.

## iOS Code Changes Required

### 1. Remove Snapshot Upload Logic

Search for and remove:
- Any code that calls `/api/upload/room/:roomId/snapshot`
- Snapshot capture logic (likely using UIGraphicsImageRenderer or similar)
- Background upload queues for snapshots
- Any retry logic for failed snapshot uploads

### 2. Update Model Classes

**Room Model:**
```swift
// Remove this property
// let snapshotUrl: String?

struct Room: Codable {
    let id: String
    let name: String
    let createdAt: Date
    let updatedAt: Date
    let createdBy: String
    let creator: User
    let participants: [Participant]
    let elementCount: Int
    let unreadCount: Int
    let hasUnread: Bool
    let lastVisitedAt: Date
    // snapshotUrl removed
}
```

### 3. Update UI Components

**Room List Cells:**
- Remove `UIImageView` for snapshot display
- Replace with:
  - Room initials (first letters of room name)
  - Participant avatars grid
  - Generic room icon
  - Color-coded placeholder based on room ID

**Example Replacement:**
```swift
// Instead of:
// cell.snapshotImageView.sd_setImage(with: URL(string: room.snapshotUrl))

// Use:
cell.placeholderView.backgroundColor = .systemGray6
cell.initialsLabel.text = room.name.prefix(2).uppercased()
```

### 4. Remove Snapshot-Related Dependencies

- Remove any image caching for snapshots (SDWebImage cache keys)
- Remove snapshot-related UserDefaults or Core Data entries
- Clean up any temporary snapshot files in Documents/Caches

### 5. Network Layer Updates

Remove or update:
- `uploadRoomSnapshot()` method
- Snapshot upload error handling
- Snapshot-related network request configurations
- Any multipart/form-data setup for snapshot uploads

### 6. Performance Considerations

Without snapshots, the iOS app should:
- Launch room list faster (no image loading)
- Use less memory (no image caching)
- Reduce network usage
- Simplify room exit flow (no snapshot capture)

## Migration Steps

1. **Update API client** to handle missing `snapshotUrl` gracefully
2. **Make model properties optional** temporarily: `let snapshotUrl: String?`
3. **Update UI** to not rely on snapshots
4. **Remove upload logic** after UI is updated
5. **Clean up model** by removing snapshot properties entirely
6. **Test edge cases**:
   - Existing rooms that had snapshots
   - New rooms created after update
   - Offline mode handling

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Room list loads without crashes
- [ ] No console errors about missing snapshotUrl
- [ ] Room cells display appropriate placeholder
- [ ] No snapshot upload attempts in network logs
- [ ] Memory usage is reduced in room list
- [ ] App doesn't attempt snapshot capture on room exit
- [ ] No orphaned snapshot files in app storage

## Potential Issues

1. **Crash on missing field**: Make sure JSON decoding handles missing `snapshotUrl`
2. **Empty image views**: Replace snapshot ImageViews with appropriate placeholders
3. **User confusion**: Users might expect to see room previews - consider adding a different visual indicator
4. **Performance**: Without snapshots to show room state, consider showing last element type or participant activity

## Alternative Visual Representations

Instead of snapshots, consider showing:
1. **Participant avatars** - Grid of 2-4 participant profile pictures
2. **Element type icons** - Icons showing types of content (notes, photos, audio)
3. **Activity indicator** - Visual representation of room activity level
4. **Room initials** - Large text with first 1-2 characters of room name
5. **Dynamic colors** - Use consistent color based on room ID hash

## Backend Performance Improvements

With snapshots removed, the iOS app should see:
- Faster `/api/rooms/my-rooms` responses (no snapshot URLs to generate)
- Reduced server processing on room exit
- Lower Cloudinary storage costs
- Simplified room state management
