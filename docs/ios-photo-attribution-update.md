# Photo Attribution Update - iOS Integration Guide

## What's Changed

The backend now includes complete attribution data for all elements (photos, notes, etc.)!

### New Fields in Element Responses

When you receive `element:created` events or join a room, each element now includes:

```json
{
  "id": "element-uuid",
  "type": "photo",
  "roomId": "room-uuid",
  "positionX": 150.5,
  "positionY": 200.0,
  "imageUrl": "https://cloudinary.com/...",
  
  // NEWLY ADDED FIELDS:
  "createdAt": "2024-01-20T15:30:45.123Z",  // ISO8601 with milliseconds
  "creator": {                               // Full creator details
    "id": "user-uuid",
    "username": "johndoe",
    "firstName": "John",
    "avatarUrl": "https://..."
  },
  
  // Existing fields:
  "createdBy": "user-uuid",
  "width": 120,
  "height": 120,
  "rotation": 0,
  "scaleX": 1,
  "scaleY": 1
}
```

## iOS Implementation

### 1. Update Your Element Model

```swift
struct Element: Codable {
    let id: String
    let type: String
    let roomId: String
    let positionX: Double
    let positionY: Double
    let imageUrl: String?
    
    // Add these new fields:
    let createdAt: Date        // Use ISO8601 decoder
    let creator: Creator?      // Optional for backwards compatibility
    
    // Existing fields...
    let createdBy: String
    let width: Double
    let height: Double
}

struct Creator: Codable {
    let id: String
    let username: String
    let firstName: String
    let avatarUrl: String?
}
```

### 2. Configure Date Decoder

```swift
let decoder = JSONDecoder()
decoder.dateDecodingStrategy = .iso8601  // Handles the ISO format
```

### 3. Display Attribution

```swift
// In your photo lightbox view:
if let creator = photo.creator {
    avatarImageView.load(url: creator.avatarUrl)
    nameLabel.text = creator.firstName
    timeLabel.text = RelativeDateTimeFormatter.timeAgo(from: photo.createdAt)
    
    attributionText = "\(creator.firstName) uploaded this \(timeAgo)"
} else {
    // Fallback if creator is missing (shouldn't happen)
    attributionText = "Someone uploaded this"
}
```

## What You Get

✅ **Complete Attribution Data**:
- Full creator details (no need to look up in participants)
- Exact creation timestamp with milliseconds
- Works for ALL element types (photos, notes, audio, etc.)

✅ **Better UX**:
- "John uploaded this 5m ago" ✓
- "Sarah uploaded this 2h ago" ✓
- No more "Someone uploaded this just now" ✗

✅ **No Additional API Calls**:
- All data comes with the element
- No need to cross-reference with participants
- Works even if user left the room

## Testing

1. Create a new photo element
2. Check the socket event data - you should see `createdAt` and `creator`
3. Tap to expand the photo
4. Verify attribution shows correctly

## Backwards Compatibility

- `createdBy` field still exists (user ID)
- `creator` object is new but optional in your model
- Old elements without these fields will still work

The backend is ready - just update your models and UI to use the new data!
